# Discord-Monopoly
This is my Documatic Hackathon submission, for the Topic: Discord Games.

The Theme is MONOPOLY, and yes idk if it's copyright-allowed or not, I won't make it an public Bot, no worries, it's just for the competition.

Following repos I am using, which are not nodejs included:
- discord.js # For connecting to discord
- inquirer # For Command Line Select Menus

Following Repos I am using, **INCLUDED** in nodejs
- fs # Filesystem
- crypto

# USAGE:
- Download the .exe / Linux / macOS File
- Execute it
- Paste a Token, it will create a file called config.json with it in it 
- Then pick start & Deploy (or just start, if you deployed before)
- The Bot will be online and useable
